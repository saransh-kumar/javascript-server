There are some stack as follow :
1. Full Stack
2. MEAN Stack
3. **MERN Stack**

**MERN** is one of these technologies. 
***M*** - MONGO (Database Server) A document-oriented, No-SQL database used to store the application data.
***E*** - Express (JS Framework for REST API) The JavaScript runtime environment. It is used to run JavaScript on a machine rather than in a browser.
***A*** - React (Client Side Framework) A framework layered on top of NodeJS, used to build the backend of a site using NodeJS functions and structures. Since NodeJS was not developed to make websites but rather run JavaScript on a machine, ExpressJS was developed.
***N*** - Node.js (Server to run Node.js) A library created by Facebook. It is used to build UI components that create the user interface of the single page web application.

3-tier architecture :
- Web : *React.JS*
- Server : *Express.JS, Node.JS*
- Database : *MongoDB*

These all stack uses different-different technologies to work together to make well-functioning software. ***MERN*** is one of  popular in these stacks. Stacks are the technologies which uses different-different technologies in order to make a complete package for a stack. **The technology stack is a set of frameworks and tools used to develop a software product**. This set of frameworks and tools are very specifically chosen to work together in creating a well-functioning software.

MERN is one of several variations of theÂ MEAN-stack (MongoDB Express Angular Node), where the traditional Angular.JS frontend framework is replaced with React.JS. Other variants include MEVN (MongoDB, Express, Vue, Node), and really any frontend JavaScript framework can work.
Express and Node make up the middle (application) tier. Express.js is a server-side web framework, and Node.js the popular and powerful JavaScript server platform. Regardless of which variant you choose, ME(RVA)N is the ideal approach to working with JavaScript and JSON, all the way through.

Today **MERN** is considered as one of the *most popular stack* and most of the company is demanding for React and Angular these days. So working on MERN will keep us up-to-date to the latest technologies and *will provide so many growth and opportunities to the developers*.
